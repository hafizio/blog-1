I would imagine if there was a patch and work done towards allowing a pluggable History model, it'd be at least considered. I don't have the time at the moment to do this, but I'd imagine you could start with abstracting out the calls to read/write History, ultimately allowing for a drop in of any storage structure. \r\n\r\nIn fact, it might be interesting to leverage wycats moneta towards this end: http://github.com/wycats/moneta","updated_at":"2010/10/03 20:12:22 -0700","id":445680,"user":"jackdempsey"},{"gravatar_id":"1f74b13f1e5c6c69cb5d7fbaabb1e2cb","created_at":"2010/10/04 12:06:32 -0700","body":"I'd like to port the code from being AR-specific to using OrmAdapter.

IMHO, that is an important use case. That said, I would accept a patch to allow disabling of history via the configuration DSL.\n\nAm I wrong in believing that using OrmAdapter instead of calling ActiveRecord directly would solve this problem for you?","updated_at":"2010/10/04 12:26:30 -0700","id":447081,"user":"sferik"},{"gravatar_id":"9bee19040f2a9c6a901e33426a968135","created_at":"2010/10/04 12:23:27 -0700","body":"You are not wrong in believing that.  I've never used rails_admin, or paid attention to the mailing list.  I was innocently just wondering if anybody even used the feature.  Does it ever get discussed, do people file bugs on it, do people make feature requests on it?  Just wondering.\r\n\r\ntl;dr:  You're right.
