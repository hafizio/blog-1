# Rubyists I'm thankful for this year
Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays. I also like what's become a blogging trend of stopping and giving thanks for a few things. This year, I focus on some Rubyists that I feel don't get enough praise for the great work they do.

<a href="http://twitter.com/jnunemaker">John Nunemaker</a>. I've learned a ton just by looking through John's code. He not only churns out <a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter">great</a> <a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper">projects</a>, he's active in the discussion groups to answer questions and fix issues. I can't wait to see <a href="http://get.harmonyapp.com/">some cool things from John in 2010</a>.

<a href="http://twitter.com/edavis10">Eric Davis</a>. Let's face it, issue management isn't sexy, but Eric has done a fantastic job on the <a href="http://redmine.org">Redmine</a> team to keep improving the open source issue tracker. He's contributed a number of plugins and is always around in the forums to listen and help the n00bs. Need help deploying or maintaining Redmine in your shop? <a href="http://theadmin.org/">Hire Eric</a>.

<a href="http://twitter.com/mikeg1">Mike Gunderloy.</a> I can't start my day without a <a href="http://afreshcup.com">double shot</a> of Ruby links. Mike is also a community leader, <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">working to grow the Rails tent and bring folks in</a>. 

<h4>Who are you thankful for?</h4>
