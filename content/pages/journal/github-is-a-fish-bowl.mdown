# GitHub is a fish bowl

When you create a public repository on GitHub, the whole
world can watch you work. As developers, we feel the need to say "But
wait, it's not done yet!"

But that's the whole point of [_social coding_](http://github.com/)
isn't it? In addition to just sharing code, aren't we supposed seek out those developers more skilled than we
are and learn a thing or two? After all, if we were only interested in deconstructing
finished products, there would be no Food Network. The same goes with
software. Watching a project come together is a chance to peek into
_how_ software is built.

I started watching Rick's
[Faraday](https://github.com/technoweenie/faraday) project when it only
was a few commits old (before it was even called Faraday if I recall
correctly). Rick's approach to REST wrappers seemed intriguing and he
graciously fielded my questions as I started using it in a few pet projects.
I liked it so much I began spreading the word at conferences and
meetups,
and out of that came [Faraday
Middleware](https://github.com/pengwynn/faraday_middleware).

Faraday is now appearing in all sorts of Ruby projects and enjoys a [growing
network](https://github.com/technoweenie/faraday/network/members).
[Mislav](https://github.com/mislav) is doing a great job moving the
project forward.
Speaking for myself, it's doubtful if I would have been involved at all had I not
caught Rick working one weekend in the fish bowl.
