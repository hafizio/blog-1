# Visualizing project collaboration using pull request data

[Arfon Smith][arfon] has created some interesting graphs that visualize the
collaborative nature of a few open source projects on GitHub using pull request
data.

## Collaborative pull requests

Since the last step in the life cycle of a GitHub pull request is hopefully
hitting [the merge button][merge], it's easy to think of them just as a way of
submitting code to a project. Pull requests are so much more than that though.
Pull requests are [_discussion + code_][pr-20]. That discussion often prompts
changes to the code and more commits to the branch behind the PR.

Using pull request data from [Octokit.rb][], Arfon visualizes how often pull
requests are truly collaborative &mdash; when commits are added to the PR after
it was opened.

> Fraction of pull requests to Octokit.rb that are collaborative over time
> (grouped by month). The size of the dot is proportional to the number of pull
> requests in that time period.

## Merge fraction

While GitHub's own [project graphs][graphs] visualize commits over time, Arfon's
merge fraction shows how often pull requests land in a project:

> Fraction of pull requests merged over time (grouped by month). The size of
> the dot is proportional to the number of pull requests in that time period

to pull the data for your own project using [the GitHub API][api].
