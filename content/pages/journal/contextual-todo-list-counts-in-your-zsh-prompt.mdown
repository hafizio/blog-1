# Contextual TODO list counts in your zsh prompt

One of the nuggets I picked up from [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
was putting a count of my [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) items [in my right side zsh prompt](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/prompt.zsh#L77).
That little number now nags me any time I use my terminal.

Then I had the idea of displaying contextual counts for all those `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `HACK` notes we often use in our projects. With some help from [Jesse](http://jessedearing.com/), my dream has come true:

Now, if I'm in a project with any of those custom notes, the counts appear in my right side prompt in addition to my regular personal todo.txt tally. Check the [function in my dotfiles repo](http://wynn.fm/mx) if you're intrested or have ideas on how to improve it.
