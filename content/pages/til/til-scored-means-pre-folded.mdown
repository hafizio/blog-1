# TIL: Scored means pre-folded

Courtesy of [my lovely wife](http://twitter.com/mrspengwynn) in a bout
of frustration trying to assemble a birthday present gift box, today I learned
that
[_scoring_](http://www.instructables.com/id/Trendy-note-card-gift-set/step3/Score-and-fold/)
 is the technical term for prefolding paper materials.
