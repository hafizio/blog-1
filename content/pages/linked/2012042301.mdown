# dotfiles.github.com

As I've [written
previously](http://wynnnetherland.com/journal/dotfiles-discovery), I've learned
_a lot_ just by digging through dotfiles on GitHub. [Adam
Jahnke](http://twitter.com/adamyonk) and I set up [a
guide](http://dotfiles.github.com) to help others looking to fork, share, and
mine them for tips and tricks.

We're starting small, but we aim to be a curated list of the best dotfile projects, files, and one liners, which we'll dispense at the @[octodots](http://twitter.com/octodots) Twitter handle.
