# Bootstrapping consistency

Thoughtbot [recently shared][setup] how they use a `./bin/setup` script to help
new developers install a Rails project quickly.

At GitHub, we use `script/bootstrap`, but the idea is the same &mdash; a consistent
user experience to get from zero to productive on any new project. Whether
I'm [writing docs][docs], [extending GitHub with service hooks][hooks], or
hacking our internal support tools, I know I can just clone the repository and
run `script/bootstrap` to jump right in. 

Thanks to [a patch][patch] from [Matt Emborsky][], this works for [my dots][dots], too.
