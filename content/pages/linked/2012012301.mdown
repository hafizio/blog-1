# Metadown

Nice gem from [Steve
Klabnik](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-1-23-introducing-metadown) that extracts metadata from and parses
Markdown files. Embedding post metadata in YAML format at the top of the
file is a common approach employed by several static site
generators such as [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll),
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/), and
[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) as well as
[NestaCMS](http://nestacms.org), the CMS that powers this site. Nesta's metadata isn't pure
YAML and at times I wish it were.
