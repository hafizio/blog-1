# Unread

[Jared Sinclair][] on the philosophy behind [Unread][], his soon-to-be-released
RSS app:

> I still love RSS. Itâ€™s the best way for thoughtful, independent writers to be
> read widely and carefully, despite how much the design of a typical RSS app
> may get in the way of their words.

> [...]

> Let Unread be an opportunity to break away from your old reading habits. Let
> Twitter or App.net be the place for loud, busy feeds. Let RSS be the place
> where great independent writing thrives. Choose your favorite writers and
> read them closely.

This. [RSS isn't dead][ooops], but perhaps the notion of the "newsreader" is,
replaced by [the stream][]. Twitter, Facebook, and the rest have enabled me to
massively unsubscribe to general and niche news sites, but RSS has remained the
way I follow my favorite authors more closely.
