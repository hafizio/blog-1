# Making a blogazine with NestaCMS

For those who envy the per-post designs of the [Peepcode
Blog](http://blog.peepcode.com/archives), [Graham Ashton](https://twitter.com/#!/grahamashton) has a nice writeup
on his [blogazine
plugin](https://github.com/gma/nesta-plugin-blogazine) for Nesta, the
software delivering these very words to your computer screen. Nesta also
powers [The Sass Way](http://thesassway.com) and will run [The
Changelog](http://thechangelog.com) in the very near future. Definitely
more to come on this topic.
