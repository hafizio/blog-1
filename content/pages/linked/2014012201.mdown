# Nomad - world-class command line utilities for iOS development

I don't know if anybody ships like [Mattt][]. [Nomad][nomad] continues a long line
of work to make Apple's tools more approachable for those of us who reside in
the shell:

> [Nashville](https://github.com/nomad/nashville) is named after the [eponymous Capital of Country Music (and
> Tennesee)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee), home of [the
> Grand 'Ole Opry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry) and the
> [Country Music Hall of Fame and
> Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum).
> It's part of a series of world-class command-line utilities for iOS
> development, which includes [Cupertino](https://github.com/mattt/cupertino)
> (Apple Dev Center management), [Shenzhen](https://github.com/mattt/shenzhen)
> (Building & Distribution), [Houston](https://github.com/mattt/houston) (Push
> Notifications), [Venice](https://github.com/mattt/venice) (In-App Purchase
> Verification), and [Dubai](https://github.com/mattt/dubai) (Passbook pass
> generation).
