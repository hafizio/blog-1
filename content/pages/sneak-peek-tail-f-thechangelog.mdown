# Sneak peek: tail -f thechangelog
I wanted to give you my readers (all five of you) a sneak peek at a little something <a href="http://twitter.com/adamstac">Adam</a> and I have been working on over at <a href="http://thechangelog.com">The Changelog</a>.

<h4>Introducing tail.thechangelog.com</h4>

Adam and I are always looking for ways to discover what's fresh and new in open source so we built a little application that helps you drink from the <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> firehose. Tail gives you a real-time view of all public GithHub events and lets you filter by event type and programming languages. It still has some rough spots but we'd love to get your feed back here or just send a tweet to <a href="http://twitter.com/changelogshow">@changelogshow</a>.
